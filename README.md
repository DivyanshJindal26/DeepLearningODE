# Information

- This is my assignment for deep learning method to solve the differential equation y = x and y = 121\*x.
- I am using PyTorch for this.

# Steps to run

- Environment Name: `myenv`
- Steps to run this

```python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

- To leave the venv, run `deactivate`

# Models

- 'ode_x.pth' is for y=x
- 'ode_121x.pth' is for y=121\*x (my roll number)
